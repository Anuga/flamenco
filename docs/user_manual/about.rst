Brender is a distributed rendering solution for the 3D animation suite 
Blender. It supports many features that make it a perfect fit for a small 
or medium CG studio, such as workstations/nodes availability scheduling, 
project management, render previews via web interface, pre and post-render 
actions.

Main features
=============

* Runs on Linux and OSX (Windows currently not supported due to paths)
* Automatic detection of clients
* Multiple Project
* Stats on shot completions
* Priority system


Supported software
==================

Brender is designed to be quite flexible and support other software than
just blender. The integration of other packages is not possible just yet
but if you are interested to work on this, feel free to get in touch and 
we will figure out how to do it.
