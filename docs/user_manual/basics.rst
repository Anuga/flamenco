Installing brender
==================

There are two ways to install brender: the first one, recommended for
final users, is using the installer (which does not exist yet). It's
basically a package containing all the dependencies needed by brender
to make it run out of the box.
The second way is the development one, that involves making a python 
virtual environament and istalling the dependencies manually.

Brender is currently not ready for deployment, we are still working on it!
