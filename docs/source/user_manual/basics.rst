Installing flamenco
===================

Currently the only way to install blender is to get the files from GitHub,
either by downloading an archived release package, or by cloning the git
repo:

    git clone https://github.com/fsiddi/flamenco.git

You can then follow the instructions on how to set up a virtual environment
in the readme.md file.
